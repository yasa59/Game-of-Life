# Game-of-Life
I created ParticleLife, a CUDA-powered particle simulator inspired by Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. It uses C++ and GPU acceleration to move 1000 particles on a 512x512 grid in real time. Particles have positions (x, y) and velocities (vx, vy), wrapping around edges for life-like motion. Positions print every 100 steps.
